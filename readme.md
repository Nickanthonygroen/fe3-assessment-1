# Top languages by number of speaker

## Explore


It looks like the data must be used to compare to each other. I think a bar chart is the best way to do this. A pie chart would be to messy as it would hold to much variables.


## Process

The data consists of two columns, one column for the languages and another for the amount of people that actually speak the language. By using a bar chart you can see the languages ordered from most spoken language to the least spoken language.

I've searched for a simple bar chart and used code from the following graph:

At some point I had to change the format of the amount of people who spoke the language since 1.000.000.0000.000 wasn't really legible. For this I used this code:

And lastly I used some styling code to make sure the languages were legible so I used this:

I referenced all the code above in my script near the code where it was used.


## Review

I tried to match the bar chart to the data as best as possible. I think it was the best way to show the data in a legible way. Maybe something with geolocation would have been awesome and could have been a nice enhancement for the future.
